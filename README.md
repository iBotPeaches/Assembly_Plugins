#Main Project (Assembly)

## What is this?

What will hopefully be merged into Assembly is my solution to Plugin problems. People mantain there own collections of plugins and then loose track of them and people end of mapping out whats already been done.

This extension will bring support into Assembly for people to push / pull / merge plugins all natively inside Assembly. Using a global revision control (Users w/ GitHub accounts) can push their plugin changes upstream for a maintainer to oversee (then if good, merge into final plugin set). Then all users can / will be alerted of a new plugin set.
